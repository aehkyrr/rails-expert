# CodeQL Configuration
# https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/code-scanning/creating-an-advanced-setup-for-code-scanning/customizing-your-advanced-setup-for-code-scanning
#
# This configuration excludes educational example files from CodeQL analysis.
# These files demonstrate Rails patterns and are never executed as actual Rails code.

name: "Rails Expert Plugin CodeQL Config"

# Paths to exclude from analysis
# Example files contain intentional patterns that trigger false positives:
# - CSRF warnings on controller examples (they inherit from ApplicationController in real apps)
# - API controllers correctly skip CSRF (APIs use token auth)
paths-ignore:
  # Educational example files - not executable Rails code
  - "**/examples/*.rb"
  - "**/skills/**/examples/**"
  # Test fixtures if any
  - "**/fixtures/**"
  - "**/test_data/**"

# Query filters to reduce noise
# Uncomment to disable specific queries if needed
# query-filters:
#   - exclude:
#       id: rb/csrf-protection-not-enabled
